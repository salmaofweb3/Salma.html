        <h1>SALMA</h1>

        <P>My name is Salma Imagah, I was born on May 9th 2005. I am a student of Rivers State University.</P>
        <p>Currently on my IT at Sarvic Industrial Services Ltd. Wonderful colleagues I work with.</p>
        <br>Well I decided to learn a skill, and Web development seemed like the one with a better oppurtunity. 
        <p>Because of the fact that you can actually work with it in real life for companies and also in Web3.</p>

        Things I enjoy doing aren't so much but here you go
        <ul><li>Musicccccccccc</li>
            <li>Being productive</li>
           <li>Basketball</li>
           <li>Football</li>
           <li>Eating actually too</li>
        <li>Designing </li> </ul>
           
           Things I don't like:
           <ol> 
            <li>Frustration</li>
            <li>Stagnation</li>

           </ol>


           I was asked to share an Image I like, so I thought why not share the one I designed on Canva for Monad?
           Check it out below:

         <br> <em>Earlier I mentioned I <strong>LOVE MUSIC</strong> I think I actually listen to almost every variety. I'm talking from Afro beats to alte to trap, rap, RnB, mention it I'm there already.
        I actually enjoy listening to Burna Boy and my favourite of his song is Spiritual.
   No need to go to your music app I got you.
   <br> You can listen to it below </em>  

   <br> <audio controls> <source src="Burna-Boy-Spiritual.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> </audio>

   <p>I forgot to add that I enjoy watching football also. My Favourite club is Liverpool Football club.
    Recently Szobozlai scored a Worldie freekick against Arsenal.
Watch it and be absolutely appauled! </p>
